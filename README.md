Note: I thought it would be interesting to test how the density of a forest effects the spread of forest fire.

# Forest Fire Simulation

## 1. Model Structure and Parameters
- 100 x 100 lattice (2-Dimensional)
- Lattice is randomly populated by 'trees'
- One tree is randomly chosen to be the origin of fire
- Model runs until there are no more burning trees
- Trees burn for one timestep
- A live tree directly in contact with a burning tree will catch fire
- 100 iterations for each tested parameter

## 2. Analysis
